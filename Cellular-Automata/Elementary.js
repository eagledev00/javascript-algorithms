 * My personal take on the explanation of Elementary Cellular Automata:
 *
 * Elementary 1D cellular automata defines the growth and decay of populations of "cells" according to a specific rule, where the population is a line (array) and each cell is in either an "alive" (1) or a "dead" (0) state.
 *
 * The next generation of for a cell in the simulation ONLY depends on the state of its neighborhood (the state of the cell itself as well as the states of the cells to the immediate right and the immediate left)
 * Therefore, since each neighborhood consists of 3 cells each with 2 states there are 2^3 possibilities that determine a cell's next state, where each possible neighborhood could be represented in binary as
 *
 * 111
 * 110
 * 101
 * 100
 * 011
 * 010
 * 001
 * 000
 *
 * Where "1" represents the cell being alive and "0" represents the cell being dead. The leftmost bit represents the left neighbor of the currently analyzed cell, the middle bit represents the currently analyzed cell, and the rightmost bit represents the right neighbor of the currently analyzed cell.
 *
 * Rules are represented between 0 and 255 (0 and 255 inclusive), or more conceptually is seen as an 8 bit binary number. Each bit represents whether a cell should survive according to one of the 8 states of a cell's neighborhood. In this way, the number can act like an array of data of length 8.
 * The most significant bit (ex: ->10100100 ) represents the output for the "all on" state while the least significant bit (ex: 10100100<- ) represents the output for the "all off" state
 * In other words, all of the 8 possible neighborhood configurations map toward the 8 bits in a rule's output values
 *
 * Therefore, to find whether the a cell is born, survives, or dies, one could convert the state of a cell and it's neighbors into a binary number, then use the numerical value of that binary number as an index to find the corresponding rule's output, which is what has been implemented below
 * This analysis of a cell's neighborhood is performed on each cell in a generation until a new generation is created and returned.
 *
 * Rules are usually demonstrated visually by how a single cell grows independently according to that rule
 *

 * DEV NOTE: This implementation assumes that cells on the edge (who only have 1 neighbor) have 1 neighbor and a permanently "dead" neighbor, which is technically correct in a finite space. However, most diagrams of these elementary cellular automata rules assume a infinite line of cells. Therefore, the edges of the array may not evolve perfectly in line with pictured diagrams which assume infinite space.
